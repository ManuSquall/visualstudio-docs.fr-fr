# <a name="support-for-the-visual-studio-sdk"></a>Support for the Visual Studio SDK
Several support options are available for customers who have questions about how to extend the Visual Studio integrated development environment (IDE).  
  
## <a name="free-support"></a>Free Support  
  
### <a name="msdn-development-center"></a>MSDN Development Center  
 The [Visual Studio Extensibility Developer Center](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=84381) on MSDN contains resources that help answer questions about how to extend Visual Studio. For example, there are several links to VSIP developer blogs.  
  
### <a name="microsoft-newsgroups"></a>Microsoft Newsgroups  
 Members of the Visual Studio development team and other developers who extend Visual Studio often participate in the microsoft.public.vstudio.extensibility newsgroup. This newsgroup is a managed newsgroup. If you are an MSDN Universal Subscriber, make sure that you register a no-spam alias to make it possible for Microsoft to respond.  
  
### <a name="msdn-forums"></a>MSDN Forums  
 The [MSDN Forums](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=76632) provide another way to chat with peers and experts. The graphical user interface (UI) of the forums is designed to make them easier to use than newsgroups. The [Visual Studio Extensibility Forum](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=121964) is a good place to start to search for answers to extensibility questions. Always search before you ask a question because someone else may already have asked the same question.  
  
### <a name="visual-studio-gallery"></a>Visual Studio Gallery  
 The [Visual Studio Gallery](http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/) is the place for extensions and sample code. You can find tools that improve your productivity and user experience with Visual Studio, sample applications that show how to use VSPackages and the Managed Extensibility Framework (MEF), and other kinds of samples.  
  
### <a name="visual-studio-sdk-samples"></a>Visual Studio SDK Samples

You can find open source examples of VS SDK extensions on GitHub at [Visual Studio Samples](https://github.com/Microsoft/VSSDK-Extensibility-Samples). This GitHub repository contains samples that illustrate various extensible features in Visual Studio.

## <a name="included-support"></a>Included Support  
  
### <a name="visual-studio-product-support"></a>Visual Studio Product Support  
 Some support is included with the purchase of [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] products. For more information, see [Visual Studio Support](http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/cc136615.aspx). Microsoft maintains a dedicated support team to answer questions about [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] extensibility.  
  
### <a name="msdn-subscription-support"></a>MSDN Subscription Support  
 MSDN subscription packages may also include some support. For more information, see [MSDN Subscriber Support](https://msdn.microsoft.com/subscriptions/aa718661.aspx).  
  
## <a name="paid-support"></a>Paid Support  
  
### <a name="developer-tools-support"></a>Developer Tools Support  
 Support can also be purchased. A variety of support offerings are available under the Developer Tools category at [Microsoft Help and Support Centers](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=82383).  
  
 Customers who want to use the [!INCLUDE[vsipsdk](../extensibility/includes/vsipsdk_md.md)] to develop complex packages can consider purchasing a Premier Support contract with Microsoft. For more information, see [Microsoft Premier Support](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=76660). For small companies, [Partner Advantage Support](http://www.microsoft.com/services/microsoftservices/srv_mspa.mspx) may be an attractive alternative to a traditional Premier Support offering.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Standard support cannot be used for consultation or to obtain advice.  
  
 Questions about Premier Support offerings in conjunction with the VSIP program can be sent to [vsipsvs@microsoft.com](mailto:vsipsvs@microsoft.com). Questions about the new Partner Advantage program can be sent to [advantg@microsoft.com](mailto:advantg@microsoft.com).  
  
 Information about individual support requests can be found at [Individual Support Requests](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=82385).
