## <a name="cause"></a>Cause  
 A public or protected member has a [Link Demands](/dotnet/framework/misc/link-demands) and is called by a member that does not perform any security checks.  
  
## <a name="rule-description"></a>Rule Description  
 A link demand checks the permissions of the immediate caller only. If a member `X` makes no security demands of its callers, and calls code protected by a link demand, a caller without the necessary permission can use `X` to access the protected member.  
  
## <a name="how-to-fix-violations"></a>How to Fix Violations  
 Add a security [Data and Modeling](/dotnet/framework/data/index) or link demand to the member so that it no longer provides unsecured access to the link demand-protected member.  
  
## <a name="when-to-suppress-warnings"></a>When to Suppress Warnings  
 To safely suppress a warning from this rule, you must make sure that your code does not grant its callers access to operations or resources that can be used in a destructive manner.  
  
## <a name="example"></a>Example  
 The following examples show a library that violates the rule, and an application that demonstrates the library's weakness. The sample library provides two methods that together violate the rule. The `EnvironmentSetting` method is secured by a link demand for unrestricted access to environment variables. The `DomainInformation` method makes no security demands of its callers before it calls `EnvironmentSetting`.  
  
 [!code-csharp[FxCop.Security.UnsecuredDoNotCall#1](../code-quality/codesnippet/CSharp/ca2122-do-not-indirectly-expose-methods-with-link-demands_1.cs)]  
  
## <a name="example"></a>Example  
 The following application calls the unsecured library member.  
  
 [!code-csharp[FxCop.Security.TestUnsecuredDoNot1#1](../code-quality/codesnippet/CSharp/ca2122-do-not-indirectly-expose-methods-with-link-demands_2.cs)]  
  
 This example produces the following output.  
  
 **Value from unsecured member: seattle.corp.contoso.com**
