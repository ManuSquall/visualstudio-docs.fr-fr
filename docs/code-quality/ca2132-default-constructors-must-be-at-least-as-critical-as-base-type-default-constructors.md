> [!NOTE]
>  This warning is only applied to code that is running the CoreCLR (the version of the CLR that is specific to Silverlight Web applications).  
  
## <a name="cause"></a>Cause  
 The transparency attribute of the default constructor of a derived class is not as critical as the transparency of the base class.  
  
## <a name="rule-description"></a>Rule Description  
 Types and members that have the <xref:System.Security.SecurityCriticalAttribute> cannot be used by Silverlight application code. Security-critical types and members can be used only by trusted code in the .NET Framework for Silverlight class library. Because a public or protected construction in a derived class must have the same or greater transparency than its base class, a class in an application cannot be derived from a class marked SecurityCritical.  
  
 For CoreCLR platform code, if a base type has a public or protected non-transparent default constructor then the derived type must obey the default constructor inheritance rules. The derived type must also have a default constructor and that constructor must be at least as critical default constructor of the base type.  
  
## <a name="how-to-fix-violations"></a>How to Fix Violations  
 To fix the violation, remove the type or do not derive from security non-transparent type.  
  
## <a name="when-to-suppress-warnings"></a>When to Suppress Warnings  
 Do not suppress warnings from this rule. Violations of this rule by application code will result in the CoreCLR refusing to load the type with a <xref:System.TypeLoadException>.
